The strawberry plant shows clear signs of water stress including wilted, limp leaves that appear dull and lack turgor pressure. The soil surface appears dry and cracked, and the plant shows reduced vigor. Leaves may be curling inward and the overall plant structure appears stressed. Immediate deep watering is required, followed by consistent irrigation to maintain soil moisture. Apply mulch around the plant base to help retain moisture and reduce evaporation."}]}
